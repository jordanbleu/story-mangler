# ManglerBot.CommandGen

This is a one-off utility to register all slash commands with discord.  To use, simply run the console app.
Make sure that you've taken all steps in the setup section located in the project root directory.

## How to run this

* Kill the docker container instance (not technically needed but it's cleaner)
* This exists outside of docker, just just run as a console app.

## When to run this 

* If a new discord command is added or removed
* If the command's description or name is modified
* If the parameters change
